**fast-subcheck** is a fast and professional subdomain enumeration tool with a live CLI interface. Written in Python, it allows you to quickly identify active subdomains by providing a target domain and a wordlist file. The command-line interface (CLI), powered by the `rich` library, delivers real-time statistics and a visually appealing output, with results automatically saved to a file.

## Features

- **Live CLI Statistics**: Real-time display of:
  - Total subdomains generated
  - Subdomains tested
  - Active (live) subdomains
  - Inactive subdomains
- **Multithreaded Scanning**: Configurable thread count for faster enumeration.
- **Output Storage**: Automatically saves active subdomains to a specified file.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Professional CLI Interface**: Colorful and organized output using the `rich` library.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles network issues, timeouts, and invalid subdomains gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Required Libraries**:
  ```bash
  pip install requests rich
Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/TahaHatami/fast-subcheck.git
cd fast-subcheck

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is unavailable, run:
bashpip install requests rich


Usage
The tool is executed via the command line. Provide a target domain (using -d) and a wordlist file (using -w) containing subdomain prefixes (e.g., www, api). Active subdomains are saved to the specified output file (using -o).
Basic Syntax:
bashpython subcheck.py -d <domain> -w <wordlist_file> -o <output_file> [options]
Required Arguments

-d <domain>: Target domain (e.g., example.com)
-w <wordlist_file>: Text file with subdomain prefixes (one per line)
-o <output_file>: File to store active subdomains

Optional Arguments

--threads <number>: Number of concurrent threads (default: 10)
--timeout <seconds>: Request timeout in seconds (default: 5)
--help: Display the help message

The tool combines prefixes from the wordlist with the target domain, checks subdomains concurrently, displays live statistics in the terminal, and saves active subdomains to the output file.
Configuration
Customize the tool via command-line arguments or by modifying default values in the script:

THREAD_COUNT: Default number of threads (10)
TIMEOUT: Default request timeout (5 seconds)
OUTPUT_FILE: Output file name (specified via -o)

The tool uses the requests library for HTTP checks (HEAD requests with status codes 200â€“399) and the rich library for progress bars and tables in the CLI.
Examples
Basic Usage
bashpython subcheck.py -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -o output.txt
Sample Wordlist (wordlist.txt):
textwww
api
test
invalid
Terminal Output:
text[Progress] Total: 4 | Tested: 4 | Active: 2 | Inactive: 2
Output File (output.txt):
textwww.example.com
api.example.com
Custom Configuration
bashpython subcheck.py -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -o results.txt --threads 20 --timeout 10
